# 🏥 HOSPITAL DATA ANALYSIS – POWER BI DASHBOARD
## 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW
*This project focuses on analyzing hospital patient data using Power BI to uncover insights into admissions, treatments, discharges, and patient demographics. The goal is to help hospital administrators make data-driven decisions to optimize resources and improve patient care.*

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES
📊 Identify patient demographics (age, gender, etc.).

🏥 Analyze admission and discharge trends.

⏳ Track average length of stay for patients.

🏗️ Evaluate hospital resource utilization (beds, departments).

🩺 Identify top reasons for patient visits and treatment effectiveness.

📈 Provide data-driven insights for better healthcare management.

## 📂 DATASET DETAILS
The dataset includes the following key attributes:

* Patient ID – Unique identifier for each patient.
* Age & Gender – Demographic details.
* Admission & Discharge Date – Hospital stay details.
* Department – Specialization (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology).
* Diagnosis – Primary reason for admission.
* Treatment & Outcome – Recovery and discharge status.
* Length of Stay – Total days spent in the hospital.
