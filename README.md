📊 Hospital Data Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
🔍 Project Overview
This project involves analyzing hospital patient data to gain insights into key healthcare metrics, including admissions, treatments, discharges, and patient demographics. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard that helps visualize trends and improve decision-making in healthcare management.

🎯 Objectives
Identify patient demographics (age, gender, etc.).
Analyze admission and discharge trends.
Track average length of stay for patients.
Evaluate hospital resource utilization (beds, departments).
Identify top reasons for patient visits and treatment effectiveness.
Provide data-driven insights for hospital administration.
📌 Dataset Details
The dataset contains information about:

Patient ID – Unique identifier for each patient.
Age, Gender – Demographic data.
Admission & Discharge Date – Hospitalization details.
Department – Specialization (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology).
Diagnosis – Primary reason for admission.
Treatment & Outcome – Recovery status.
Length of Stay – Days spent in hospital.
🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI – Dashboard creation & data visualization.
SQL – Data extraction and transformation.
Excel/CSV – Data preprocessing.
📈 Key Insights from the Dashboard
✅ Admission Trends: Identifies peak admission months & busiest departments.
✅ Patient Demographics: Helps in resource allocation & targeted care.
✅ Length of Stay Analysis: Reduces overcrowding & optimizes treatment.
✅ Treatment Outcomes: Helps measure recovery rates & effectiveness.
